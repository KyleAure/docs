= Open Liberty SPIs

Third-party developers can extend and customize the functions of the Open Liberty application server by using Service Provider Interfaces, or Open Liberty SPIs. These SPIs promote flexibility and maintainability by enabling developers to add new functions, incorporate extensions, or connect Open Liberty with other systems, all without altering the core software.
