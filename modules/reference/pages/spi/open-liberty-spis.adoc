= Open Liberty SPIs

Open Liberty Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs) enable the extension and customization of various runtime capabilities. User features promote flexibility and maintainability, allowing developers to add new functions, incorporate extensions, or connect Open Liberty with other systems without altering the core software.

With Liberty's xref:ROOT:zero-migration-architecture.adoc[Zero Migration] policy, you can rest assured that future releases will continue to provide these SPIs.
