== Options

.Options for the server start command

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Option
|Description

|--clean
|Cleans all persistent cached information that is related to the specified server instance, which includes OSGi resolver metadata and persistent OSGi bundle data.
If you use this option, the server is required to recompute any cached data at the next startup, which might take more time than a restart that reuses cached data.

|--variable_name=_variable_value_
|Defines variables. Include `--` in the command before you specify the option, as shown in the usage example.
{empty} +
{empty} +
Variables that are specified on the command line override all other sources of variables and can't be changed after the server starts.
