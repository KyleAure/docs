== Examples

=== Configure a BELL

The minimum `server.xml` configuration for the BELL feature requires a `library` element and a `bell` element that references the library.

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<library id="servicesLib">
  <file name="_path to jar_">
</library>

<bell libraryRef="servicesLib" />
----

The BELL feature discovers all services in the `META-INF/services` folder of the referenced library. Alternatively, you can configure the `service` attribute to specify the name of the service the feature looks up in the `META-INF/service` folder, as shown in the following example.

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<bell libraryRef="servicesLib"
   service="_name.of.fully.qualified.api.or.spi.interface_" />
----

For every service that is discovered or specified, the BELL feature registers the service interface and implementation class as an OSGi service, which makes the service available to the Open Liberty runtime.

Be sure to enable the Open Liberty features that provide the API or SPI packages that are required by the library.

=== Enable SPI access for libraries

Shared libraries do not support access for SPI packages. When a library provides an implementation
of an SPI interface, set the `spiVisibility` attribute to `true` in the BELL configuration. This attribute enables the library classloader to access SPI packages that are provided by Open Liberty.

[source,xml]
----
<bell libraryRef="servicesLib" spiVisibility="true"/>
----

SPI visibility is disabled by default and applies only to the library that is referenced in the BELL configuration. SPI visibility is not supported for the Open Liberty `global` shared library.

=== Enable services to receive configuration properties

Services can receive properties that are declared in the BELL configuration. To configure properties, add a `properties` element to your BELL configuration and declare one or more `name="value"` attributes. Properties are String type and inject into all services that are enabled to receive them. The following example declares the `hello` and `serverHome` properties.

[source,xml]
----
<bell libraryRef="servicesLib">
 <properties hello="WORLD" serverHome="${server.output.dir}" />
</bell>
----

To enable a service to receive configuration properties, define a public method that is named named `updateBell` or a public constructor in the service implementation class. The method signature must declare a single parameter of the `java.util.Map<String,String>` type. The following example defines both methods to receive properties in a BELL configuration.

[source,java]
----
public class YourServiceImpl implements api.or.spi.Interface {
 public YourServiceImpl(Map<String,String> bellProps) {...}
 // OR
 public void updateBell(Map<String,String> bellProps) {...}
}
----

At service creation, the BELL feature invokes the `updateBell` constructor or methods to inject an unmodifiable map that contains a `key/value` pair for each property. For the previous examples, the resulting map contains the pairs `"hello"/"WORLD"` and `"serverHome"/"<resolved value of ${server.out.dir}>"`

The BELL feature does not support nondestructive updates. When you update a BELL configuration while the server is running, the feature does not inject updated `properties` into existing service instances. However, it affords this future enhancement by allowing users to define the `updateBell` method within the service implementation class. If you define the `updateBell` method to receive properties, ensure that the class can tolerate multiple calls to the `updateBell` method on the same instance.

=== Configure a servlet filter for applications

In certain scenarios, a servlet filter implementation must be applied to all applications that are deployed to Open Liberty. For example, a servlet filter might be used to add new headers to each request. The `jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer` interface provides an `onStartup` method that you can use to add a servlet filter implementation class to all applications.

You can use the BELL feature to configure a library that provides a `ServletContainerInitializer` implementation as a service. The `ServletContainerInitializer` service `onStartup` method is called by Open Liberty for each application that starts. In the following example, a `ServletContainerInitializer` implementation is configured to add a servlet filter implementation with each `ServletContext` object that is in a Java file. The `ServletContext.addFilter(String, Filter)` method is used by the `onStartup` method to add the servlet filter implementation.

[source,java]
----
public class SCI implements ServletContainerInitializer {
  @Override
  public void onStartup(Set<Class<?>> arg0, ServletContext arg1)
    throws ServletException {
    arg1.addFilter("myFilter", MyFilter.class).addMappingForUrlPatterns(null, false, "/*");
  }
}
----

To register the `ServletContainerInitializer` interface that adds the servlet filter for an application, a class name is specified in the library JAR file. The library JAR file contains a `META-INF/services/jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer` file that specifies the fully qualified `ServletContainerInitializer` implementation class name that is contained in the library. The following example uses the `file` element to specify a path to the JAR file and add it to the library. It also specifies the service that the BELL feature looks up and registers.


[source,xml,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<library id="servletExtLib">
  <file name="_path to jar_"/>
</library>

<bell libraryRef="servletExtLib"
    service="jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer" />
----

=== Expose a new REST endpoint

The REST Handler framework provides the `com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler` interface, which Open Liberty extension developers use to expose new REST endpoints. You can use the BELL feature to configure a library that provides a `RESTHandler` implementation as a service and enables the REST Handler framework to register the service as a listener for a new specified endpoint URL.

 In the following service implementation example, the `BellEndpoint` class overrides the `handleRequest` method and defines a single-argument constructor to receive BELL configuration properties at service creation.

[source,java]
----
package your.org.rest.example;
import com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.*;

public class BellEndpoint implements RESTHandler {
  java.util.Map<String,String> props;
  public BellEndpoint(java.util.Map<String, String> bellProperties) {props=bellProperties;}
  @Override
  public void handleRequest(RESTRequest request, RESTResponse response) {...}
}
----

For this example, the following service resource and implementation class files are packaged in the `RestEpLib.jar` file.

----
META-INF/services/com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler
your/org/rest/example/BellEndpoint.class
----

To enable the endpoint, the `/META-INF/services/com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler` service resource must declare both the `com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.root` OSGi service property in addition to the fully-qualified name of the service implementation class. This OSGI service property is required by the `RESTHandler` SPI to register the service as a listener for the specified subroot of the `/ibm/api` URL path. Set the property to equal the name of the endpoint that you want to expose on the `/ibm/api/` URL path.

Note: You can configure OSGi properties that are specific to a service implementation class by adding one or more properties, prefixed by the `#` character, to the service resource. Add the properties immediately before the name of the service implementation class to which they apply. The BELL feature registers the service interface with the implementation class and the specific OSGi properties.

The `com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.root` OSGi property in the following example enables an endpoint with the `/ibm/api/bellEP` URL path.

[source,java]
----
#com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.root=/bellEP
your.org.rest.example.BellEndpoint
----

The following example shows the BELL configuration in `server.xml` file that references the `RestEpLib` library. The configuration specifies the `spiVisibility="true"` attribute to enable the `RestEpLib` library to access the REST Handler SPI packages. It also declares one BELL property. Notice that the `RestEpLib.jar` library JAR is copied to the `${server.config.dir}/sharedlib` directory.

[source,xml]
----
<library id=”RestEpLib">
  <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/sharedLib" includes="RestEpLib.jar" />
</library>

<bell libraryRef=”RestEpLib” spiVisibility=”true">
  <properties hello=“WORLD” />
</bell>
----

The `server.xml` file requires more configuration than just the BELL to expose the endpoint. In addition to the BELL feature, you must enable the feature:restConnector[display=Admin REST Connector] (`restConnector-2.0`) and feature:transportSecurity[display=Transport Security] (`transportSecurity-1.0`) features. The Admin REST Connector feature provides the REST Handler framework SPI. Endpoint access requires secure transport and a user who is mapped to the administrator role. The Transport Security feature and the related `keyStore`, `basicRegistry` and `adminstrator-role` configurations support secure access to the endpoint. The following `server.xml` file example shows a possible configuration, including the BELL configuration from the previous example.

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>bells-1.0</feature>
  <feature>restConnector-2.0</feature>
  <feature>transportSecurity-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>

<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="keystorePassword" />
<basicRegistry>
  <user name="you" password="yourPassword" />
  <group name="yourGroup" />
</basicRegistry>
<administrator-role>
  <user>you</user>
  <group>yourGroup</group>
</administrator-role>

<library id=”RestEpLib">
  <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/sharedLib" includes="RestEpLib.jar" />
</library>

<bell libraryRef=”RestEpLib” spiVisibility=”true">
  <properties hello=“WORLD” />
</bell>
----

When this server starts, the BELL feature uses the `RestEpLib` library to register the `RESTHandler` interface with the `BellEndpoint` class and the `com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.root=/bellEP` OSGi service property into the OSGi framework. The REST Handler framework then registers the service and makes the endpoint available at the `\https://<host>:8020/ibm/api/bellEP` URL.

When you make calls to the endpoint, the REST Handler framework handles the initial request by getting an instance of the service. The BELL feature creates an instance of the `BellEndpoint` class that is injected with an unmodifiable map that contains the `"hello"/"WORLD"` key/value pair. The framework then services the initial and subsequent requests by calling the `handleRequest` method on the `BellEnpoint` instance.
