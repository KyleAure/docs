MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 is compatible with multiple versions of the feature:microprofile[display=MicroProfile umbrella feature]. It is automatically enabled when you enable `microprofile-6.1` or `microprofile-7.0`. However, it also works with `microprofile-5.0`, `microprofile-4.1`, or `microprofile-1.4` if you separately enable it alongside any of those features.
