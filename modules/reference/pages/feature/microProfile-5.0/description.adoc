MicroProfile 5.0 aligns with Jakarta EE 9.1. With this release, applications can use MicroProfile APIs together with Jakarta EE 9.1 APIs. MicroProfile 5.0 has the same functions as MicroProfile 4.1 except for dependency updates that account for changes in Jakarta API package names from `javax.\*` to `jakarta.*`.
