With the release of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 feature (`restfulWS-3.0`), the underlying Jakarta RESTful Web Services implementation for Open Liberty changed from Apache CXF to RESTEasy. This change results in certain API behavior changes that might require you to update your application code.

Jakarta RESTful Web Services, formerly known as JAX-RS, is a xref:ROOT:jakarta-ee.adoc[Jakarta EE] platform API. In Open Liberty 21.0.0.12 and later, you can use Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 functions by enabling the feature:restfulWS[display=RESTful Web Services 3.0] feature. The JAX-RS 2.0 and 2.1 implementations are available through the feature:jaxrs[display=Java RESTful Services] feature (`jaxrs-2.0` and `jaxrs-2.1`). The change in feature name and version reflects the change in API package name prefixes from `javax.\*` to `jakarta.*`, which is common to all Jakarta EE 9.1 features. For more information, see xref:jaxrs-diff.adoc[Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 behavior changes].
