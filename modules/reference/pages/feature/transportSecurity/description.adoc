When the `transportSecurity-1.0` feature is enabled, the Liberty server sets a custom SSL Socket factory that uses the `ssl.SocketFactory.provider` Java security property.
This security property is automatically set when the `transportSecurity-1.0` feature is enabled.
When you are using the `transportSecurity-1.0` feature, the `SSLContext` process is the SSLContext of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE). 
A call to `SSLContext.getDefault()` returns the default context SSLContext of the JSSE. A call to `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` returns an SSLSocketFactory that is based on the Liberty server custom socket factory provider that uses the Liberty SSLContext.
