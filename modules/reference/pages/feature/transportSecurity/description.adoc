The Transport Security feature supersedes the feature:ssl-1.0[display=Secure Socket Layer] (`ssl-1.0`) feature and adds functions that are not included with the `ssl-1.0` feature.

When the `ssl-1.0` feature is enabled, the SSL context that is obtained by the `SSLContext.getDefault()` method is the default Liberty configuration. When the Transport Security feature is enabled, the SSL context that is obtained by the `SSLContext.getDefault()` method is the SSLContext of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE).

However, when the Transport Security feature is enabled, Open Liberty also sets a custom SSL socket factory.
Therefore, the `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` method returns an SSL socket factory that is based on the Open Liberty custom socket factory provider, which uses the Open Liberty SSL context instead of the JSSE default.
Due to these differences between the Transport Security feature and `ssl-1.0` in how the default Liberty `SSLContext` class is obtained, you might need to update your application code when you change from one feature to the other, or when you migrate from Java EE to Jakarta EE.
