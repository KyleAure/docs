When the Transport Security feature is enabled, the SSL context for the process is the default SSL context of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE).
Therefore, the `SSLContext.getDefault()` method returns the default SSL context of the JSSE.
However, when this feature is enabled, Open Liberty also sets a custom SSL socket factory.
Therefore, the `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` method returns an SSL socket factory that is based on the Open Liberty custom socket factory provider, which uses the Open Liberty SSL context instead of the JSSE default.

The Transport Security feature supersedes the feature:ssl-1.0[display=Secure Socket Layer] (`ssl-1.0`) feature and adds functions that are not included with the `ssl-1.0` feature. Due to differences between the Transport Security feature and `ssl-1.0` in how the default Liberty `SSLContext` class is obtained, you might need to update your application code when you change from one feature to the other. For more information, see ssl-1.0 and transportSecurity-1.0 feature restrictions.
