Jakarta Security 3.0 allows the use of the new `OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation to configure a built-in OpenID Connect authentication mechanism. This authentication mechanism functions as an OpenID Connect client, or Relying Party (RP), so that you can use an OpenID Connect Provider(OP) as a single sign-on identity provider.
