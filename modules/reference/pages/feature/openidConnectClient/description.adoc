You can configure an Open Liberty server to function as an OpenID Connect client, or Relying Party (RP), so that you can use an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) as a single-sign-on identity provider.

You can use the `OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation in a web or RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) application to enable an OpenID Connect client for that application. This annotation is supported when you enable the feature:appSecurity-5.0[display=Application Security] feature version 5.0 or later. You do not need to enable the OpenID Connect Client feature to use this annotation. For more information, For more information, see xref:ROOT:enable-openid-connect-client.adoc[Enable an OpenID Connect client for an application].
