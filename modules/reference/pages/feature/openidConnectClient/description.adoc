You can configure an Open Liberty server to function as an OpenID Connect client, or Relying Party (RP), so that you can use an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) as a single-sign-on identity provider.

If you are updating your application from using the `appSecurity-4.0` feature to using the `appSecurity-5.0` feature, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:ROOT:jakarta-ee10-diff.adoc#security[Differences between Jakarta Security 5.0 and 4.0].

You can use the `OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation in a web or RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) application to enable an OpenID Connect client for that application. This annotation is supported when you enable the feature:appSecurity-5.0[display=(Application Security 5.0)] feature version 5.0 or later. You do not need to enable the OpenID Connect Client feature to use this annotation. For more information, see Enable an OpenID Connect client for an application.
