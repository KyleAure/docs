## Faster startup for Spring applications with Liberty InstantOn
The Spring Framework and Spring Boot support of the Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint (CRaC) project integrates with xref:ROOT:instanton.adoc[Liberty InstantOn] when you enable the feature:crac-1.4[display=Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint 1.4] feature. The Spring support for checkpointing and restoring an application manages the lifecycle of resources such as socket, files, and thread pools that are used by the application. For more information, see the Spring Boot documentation on link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/deployment.html#deployment.efficient.checkpoint-restore[Checkpoint and Restore] and the Spring Framework link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/checkpoint-restore.html[Checkpoint and Restore support documentation].

## Spring Boot Starters
link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using.build-systems.starters[Spring Boot Starters] are a set of convenient dependency descriptors provided by the Spring Boot that you can include in your application. When you use these starters with a Spring Boot application that is deployed on Open Liberty, you might need to enable features beyond the Spring Boot Support feature. The following table lists the Open Liberty features that are required to support certain Spring Boot 3.0 starters.
