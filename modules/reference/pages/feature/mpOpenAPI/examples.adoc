=== Configure MicroProfile OpenAPI documentation endpoints

MicroProfile OpenAPI generates and serves OpenAPI documentation for Jakarta RESTful Services or JAX-RS applications that are deployed to the Open Liberty runtime. The OpenAPI documentation is served from the `<host>:<port>/openapi` endpoint and a user interface for browsing this documentation is served from the `<host>:<port>/openapi/ui` endpoint.

You can configure the paths for these endpoints. Specify the `docPath` and `uiPath` attributes for the `mpOpenAPI` element in your `server.xml` file. For example, the following configuration sets the OpenAPI documentation for an `appA` application to `/appA/openapi`, while the UI to browse that documentation is available at `/appA/openapi/docUi`:

[source:xml]
----
<mpOpenAPI docPath="/appA/openapi" uiPath="/appA/openapi/docUi" />
----

When the `uiPath` attribute is not set, it defaults to the value of the `docPath` attribute with `/ui` appended.
