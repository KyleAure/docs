These APIs integrate with the Liberty xref:ROOT:instanton.adoc[InstantOn support].

The link:https://javadoc.io/doc/org.crac/crac/1.4.0/index.html[org.crac] package provides APIs for receiving checkpoint/restore notifications. These notifications enable applications to perform actions before they checkpoint an application process and after they restore the application process. For example, this package allows Spring-based applications to support checkpoint and restore. The use of `org.crac` is not limited to Spring-based applications. Any application that runs on Liberty can choose to receive checkpoint/restore notifications by enabling the `crac-1.4` feature.
