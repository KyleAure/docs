With the release of the MicroProfile REST Client 3.0 feature (`mpRestClient-3.0`), the underlying MicroProfile REST Client implementation for Open Liberty changes from Apache CXF to RESTEasy. This change results in certain API behavior changes that might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:reference:mprc-dif.adoc[MicroProfile REST Client 3.0 behavior changes].
