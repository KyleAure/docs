:page-description: For Jakarta EE 9 applications to run in Open Liberty, Jakarta EE 9 features must be specified in the server configuration. In some cases, you must change both the feature version and short name to update a feature for Jakarta EE 9.

= Jakarta EE 9 feature updates

The names and version numbers of some of the Open Liberty features that support the Jakarta EE platform are updated for the Jakarta EE 9.1 release.
In some cases, you must change both the feature version and short name in your server configuration to update your server for Jakarta EE 9.1.

As part of the transition from Java EE to the open source Jakarta EE platform, the namespace of the underlying API packages changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. The Open Liberty features that support the Jakarta EE platform are also updated to reflect this change with the release of Open Liberty 21.0.0.12. For some Jakarta EE features, only the version number is changed. For others, both the feature version and short name are changed. If you are updating your server to Jakarta EE 9.1, you must specify the updated feature versions and short names in your `server.xml` file.

For example, the Contexts and Dependency Injection feature is updated from `cdi-2.0` to `cdi-3.0`. To update this feature for Jakarta EE 9.1, you need to update only the version number. However, in some cases, the feature short name is also changed, as with the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.2 feature (`ejb-3.2`), which was updated to Enterprise Beans 4.0 (`enterpriseBeans-4.0`). To update this feature, you must specify both the new version number and the new short name.

In the following server.xml file example, three Java EE features are specified.

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>servlet-4.0</feature>
    <feature>jpa-2.2</feature>
    <feature>jaxrs-2.1</feature>
  </featureManager>
</server>
----

To update this configuration to support Jakarta EE 9.1, you must specify the updated feature versions and short names. For the `servlet-4.0` feature, only the version number is changed. However, both the other features have updated version numbers and short names. The `jpa-2.2` feature becomes `persistence-3.0` and the `jaxrs-2.1` becomes `restfulWS-3.0`. The following example shows the updated configuration for Jakarta EE 9.1.

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>servlet-5.0</feature>
    <feature>persistence-3.0</feature>
    <feature>restfulWS-3.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
</server>
----

For features with updated short names, if the old short name is specified with a Jakarta EE 9.1 version number, the server does not start. In such cases, the server logs provide information to say which new feature short name must be specified.
For example, if `ejb-3.2` is incorrectly changed to `ejb-4.0`, the server logs indicate that `enterpriseBeans-4.0` must be used.

Open Liberty provides several convenience features, which can enable a whole set of features all at once. For example, the feature:jakartaee[display=Jakarta EE platform] feature enables all features that support the Jakarta EE platform. If you update this feature from the previous short name and version number, `javaee-8.0`, to `jakartaee-9.1`, all of the Jakarta EE 9.1 features are automatically enabled. For more information, see xref:reference:feature/feature-overview.adoc[Feature overview].

The following tables list the Open Liberty features that are updated for Jakarta EE 9.1. Table 1 lists the features for which only the version number is changed. Table 2 lists the features for which both the version number and short name are changed.

The following table lists features for which only the feature version is changed. To update one of these features for Jakarta EE 9.1, you must change only the feature version number in your `server.xml` file.
