= Asynchronous input and output

Asynchronous read and asynchronous write help you process inbound data and write outbound responses faster than synchronous read and synchronous write.
Asynchronous read and asynchronous write can improve the throughput of your Open Liberty server, particularly if large amounts of post data or response data must be processed.

== Asynchronous read
Consider a scenario where a client request includes two packets of data that are sent one second apart by the client.
In synchronous read, the application must occupy a thread for the entire time that the client takes to send the data.
The thread starts when the first packet is received and then waits for one second to receive the second packet, so the thread is occupied for one second.
In a server with 10 threads, you can process 10 inbound requests per second.

In asynchronous read, the application relinquishes the thread after the first packet is received from the client, and the application is redispatched when the second packet arrives.
Assume that each inbound request takes 0.1 seconds to process so that the inbound request occupies a thread for 0.2 seconds.
In this case, the same server with 10 threads can process 50 inbound requests per second.
Ideally, the throughput of your application server isn't affected by the rate at which data is received from a client.
If throughput is affected by the rate at which data is received, a few bad clients can significantly reduce throughput.
With asynchronous read, you can have more consistent throughput.

== Asynchronous read sample code
The following examples demonstrate the key requirements for implementing asynchronous read in your code.


=== Register a ReadListener
To take advantage of asynchronous read, your application must provide a `ReadListener` object that is called when inbound data is received.
The `ReadListener` object reads the data as it's received and starts the business logic after all data is read.
The `ReadListener` object is registered by a servlet, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException, ServletException {

    req.startAsync();
    req.getInputStream().setReadListener(new SampleReadListener(req, res));
}
----

This example shows a `doPost` method that includes the two steps that are required by a servlet to read asynchronously.
The implementation in the example is for the `doPost` method because a `ReadListener` object is useful only when a request includes post data.
The first step starts asynchronous processing, and the second step registers a `ReadListener` object with the `ServletInputStream` object for the request.
After these steps complete, the servlet returns to relinquish the thread.
If you need the servlet to perform extra steps, the servlet must perform these extra steps before the `ReadListener` object is set.
Otherwise, the servlet processing and the `ReadListener` object processing compete with each other.

=== Read and store inbound data
The `ReadListener` object implements three methods, `onDataAvailable`, `onAllDataRead`, and `onError`.
The `onDataAvailable` method reads and optionally stores the inbound data.
In the following example, after the inbound data is read, the inbound data is stored for processing:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onDataAvailable() throws IOException {

    byte postData[] = new byte[1024];
    int postDataLen;

    ServletInputStream inStream = _req.getInputStream();

    while (inStream.isReady() && !inStream.isFinished()) {
        postDataLen = inStream.read(postData);
        if (postDataLen > 0)
            outData.add(new String(postData, 0, postDataLen));
    }
}
----

The while loop in this example implements two key requirements:

* The `isReady()` method is called before every read of data.
If it returns a `false` value, all of the currently available data is read, so the thread is relinquished.
If the `isFinished()` method returns a `true` value, all data is read.
A second read of data that's performed after a call to the `isReady()` method is effectively a synchronous read and results in an illegal state exception for the method.
* The `onDataAvailable` method isn't called unless the `isReady` method returns a `false` value and all data is read.
If the `onDataAvailable` method returns when the `isReady` method returns a `true` value and more data is available to be read, the container doesn't call the `onDataAvailable` method again until the `isReady` method is called and returns a `false` value.
If the `onDataAvailable` method returns when the `isReady` method returns a `true` value and all of the data isn't read, your application must call the `onDataAvailable` method again to restart the read.

In this example, the inbound data is saved for later processing, although some applications might process data as they receive it.

=== Process inbound data
The `onAllDataRead` method is called by the container after all inbound data is read.
The `onAllDataRead` method performs the business logic based on the inbound data, as shown in the following example:

[#readlistener-onalldataread]
[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onAllDataRead() throws IOException {

    for (String outDataString : outData) {
        _res.getOutputStream().print(outDataString);
    }

    _req.getAsyncContext().complete();
}
----

The data is written back to the client.
After all the data is written, the asynchronous request is completed by the `AsyncContext.complete` method.

=== Log any errors
The `onError` method is called if any error occurs when the inbound data is processed.
If this method is called, it's the last method called on the `ReadListener` object.
In this example, the application returns an error message to the client and then completes the asynchronous request:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onError(Throwable arg0) {

    try {
        _res.getOutputStream().println("Exception when processing inbound data : " + arg0);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Log an error.
    }

    _asyncContext.complete();
}
----

== Asynchronous write
Asynchronous write is similar to asynchronous read, but asynchronous write is used for sending responses to the client.
Assume that a response is sent in two packets.
The first packet is sent to the client immediately, but the second packet can be sent only after the client acknowledges that the first packet is received.
In synchronous write, a thread is occupied while it waits for the client to acknowledge receipt of data.
But in asynchronous write, throughput can be increased because the thread isnâ€™t occupied while it waits for the client to acknowledge receipt of data.
Asynchronous write can be less useful than asynchronous read because your servlet and HTTP implementation might effectively perform the work of asynchronous writing.
Your application can write as much as it needs, and the underlying implementation might buffer the response and send it asynchronously.

== Asynchronous write sample code
The following examples show the key requirements to implement asynchronous write in your code.
In most applications, asynchronous read and asynchronous write are combined.
In this situation, the <<readlistener-onalldataread,ReadListener.onAllDataRead>> method registers the `WriteListener` object and provides the response data to the `WriteListener` object on its constructor.

=== Register a WriteListener
To use asynchronous write, your application must provide a `WriteListener` object, which is called when response data can be sent without blocking other processes.
The `WriteListener` object is registered by a servlet, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException, ServletException {

    req.startAsync();
    res.getOutputStream().setWriteListener(new SampleWriteListener(req, res, 200));
}
----

This example shows a `service` method that includes the two steps that are required to write asynchronously.
The `service` method is acceptable because a `WriteListener` object can be used for any inbound method, for example, the `doPost` method.
The first step starts asynchronous processing, and the second step registers a `WriteListener` object with the `ServletOutputStream` object for the request.
After these steps complete, the servlet returns to relinquish the thread.
If you need the servlet to perform extra steps, the servlet must perform these extra steps before the `WriteListener` object is set.
Otherwise, the servlet processing and the `WriteListener` object processing compete with each other.

=== Write an outbound response
The `WriteListener` object implements two methods, `onWritePossible` and `onError`.
The `onWritePossible` method is responsible for writing outbound responses:

[source,java]
----
public void onWritePossible() throws IOException {

    ServletOutputStream outStream = _res.getOutputStream();

    while (outStream.isReady() && _numWritesRemaining > 0) {
        _numWritesDone++;
        _numWritesRemaining--;
        outStream.println(_asyncEvents + "." + _numWritesDone + _outData);
    }

    if (_numWritesRemaining == 0) {
        _req.getAsyncContext().complete();
    } else {
        _asyncEvents++;
    }
}
----

The `onWritePossible` method implements three key requirements:

* The `isReady` method is called before data is written.
Data that is written a second time after a call to the `isReady` method is effectively a synchronous write and results in an illegal state exception for the method.
* The `onWritePossible` method doesn't return unless the `isReady` method returns a `false` value or all data is written.
The `onWritePossible` method might return when the `isReady` method returns a `true` value and more data must be written.
In this case, the container doesn't call the `onWritePossible` method again until the `isReady` method returns a `false` value.
* The `AsyncContext.complete` method is called to end the asynchronous request after all data is written.
An equivalent to the `onAllDataRead` method of the `ReadListener` object doesn't exist for the `WriteListener` object because only your application knows when all response data is written.

One effect of this second requirement is that all of the response data must be available before the `WriteListener` object is registered.
If the response data isn't available before the `WriteListener` object is registered, the method must return when the `isReady` method is the `true` value.
In this case, some of the response data isn't yet written.
To handle this scenario, the application can call the `onWritePossible` method, although you must ensure that two threads aren't running the `onWritePossible` method at the same time.

The `onError` method is called if any error occurs when the response data is processed.
If this method is called, it's the last method called on the `WriteListener` object.
In this case, the application generates an error log and then completes the asynchronous request.
