= API documentation with OpenAPI

MicroProfile OpenAPI helps you to generate structured documentation from your Jakarta RESTful Services or JAX-RS applications. This documentation helps other microservices and developers to understand and communicate with your application.

Other developers need relevant information to build an application that communicates with the REST API of your application.
MicroProfile OpenAPI facilitates this communication by generating human and machine-readable documentation on a simple interface that doesnâ€™t require access to the source code.

You can implement MicroProfile OpenAPI for Open Liberty by enabling the feature:mpOpenAPI[display=MicroProfile OpenAPI] feature. When this feature is enabled, you can view the OpenAPI document in a browser by using the `/openapi` endpoint. For example, if your browser is on the same machine where your server is running, you can view the raw OpenAPI document at the `\http://localhost:9080/openapi` URL or view the OpenAPI document in a user interface at the `\http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui` URL.

To explore how to document and filter RESTful APIs from code or static files by using Open Liberty and MicroProfile OpenAPI, see the link:/guides/microprofile-openapi.html[Documenting RESTful APIs] guide.

The two main approaches to generate an OpenAPI document are the code-first approach and the design-first approach.
In the code-first approach, you can generate documentation of the REST API from the source code.
The reference document that is produced lists all the API endpoints with descriptions of how to use them.
Alternatively, in the design-first approach, you can include a pre-generated OpenAPI document that was written separately from the code.
The JAX-RS framework handles basic API generation for JAX-RS annotations and generates a skeleton OpenAPI treemap.
You can use this treemap as a starting point and augment it with annotations and code to produce a complete OpenAPI document.
Additionally, you can use this manually created documentation to generate stubs, or testable versions of code modules, such as client libraries for the API.

== The code-first approach

In the code-first approach, you can initially generate basic API documentation of the REST API from annotations that are specified in the source code.
Then, you can augment the existing annotations with OpenAPI annotations, which are processed to generate the documentation.
Adding annotations takes less work than manually defining the OpenAPI document, and gives a useful explanation of the different parts of the API.

In the following example, the OpenAPI annotations `@APIResponses`, `@Operation`, and `@Parameter` are added to the `purchaseCar()` JAX-RS method.

[source,java]
----
@PUT
 @Path("/buy/{registration}")
 @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
 @Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
 @APIResponses(
         value = {
             @APIResponse(
                 responseCode = "404",
                 description = "The requested car could not be found at the dealership, and could not be purchased.",
                 content = @Content(mediaType = "text/plain")),
             @APIResponse(
                 responseCode = "200",
                 description = "The requested car was successfully purchased.",
                 content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json"))})
     @Operation(
         summary = "Purchases the specified car from the dealership, and adds the car to your garage.",
         description = "Retrieves the car with the specified registration from the dealership if it exists, and
                        adds this to the caller's garage. The boolean response represents the state of the internal operation.")
 public Response purchaseCar(
    @Parameter(
              description = "The registration of the car to be added to the inventory.",
              required = true,
              example = "NX15 9012",
              schema = @Schema(type = SchemaType.STRING))
    @PathParam("registration") String registration) {
  boolean success = manager.purchaseCar(registration);
     if (!success) {
         return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND)
                        .entity("{ \"error\" : "
                                + "\"The car with registration " + registration
                                + " could not be added to the inventory\" }")
                        .build();
     }
     return Response.ok(success).build();
 }
----

The default format of the generated document is YAML, but documents can also be provided in JSON format.
The following OpenAPI document is generated in YAML format from the OpenAPI annotations in the previous example.

[source,yaml]
----
/my-garage/buy/{registration}:
   put:
     summary: "Purchases the specified car from the dealership, and adds the car\
       \ to your garage."
     description: "Retrieves the car with the specified registration from the dealership\
       \ if it exists, and adds this to the caller's garage. The boolean response\
       \ represents the state of the internal operation."
     parameters:
     - name: registration
       in: path
       description: The registration of the car to be added to the inventory.
       required: true
       schema:
         type: string
       example: NX15 9012
     responses:
       "404":
         description: "The requested car could not be found at the dealership, and\
           \ could not be purchased."
         content:
           text/plain: {}
       "200":
         description: The requested car was successfully purchased.
         content:
           application/json: {}
----

The information that is provided through the OpenAPI annotations augments the basic API documentation that is generated by the JAX-RS framework.

For more information, see the link:reference/javadoc/microprofile-6.1-javadoc.html?package=org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/package-frame.html&class=org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/package-summary.html[MicroProfile OpenAPI Javadoc] for the available annotations.

== The design-first approach

An alternative approach is to design the REST API in an editor, such as the link:https://editor.swagger.io/[Swagger] editor, before you write any code.
With this approach, you can spot and rectify any issues in the design before it is implemented.
In large companies, subject matter experts review the API to ensure it's consistent and usable.
This API design then forms a contract and must be implemented as agreed.

You can write this API design in YAML or JSON format and place it in the `META-INF` directory of your application.
Optionally, you can create stubs for the API code.
The code-first and design-first approaches are not mutually exclusive.
You can augment manually created API documents by adding annotations to the code as you would in a code-first approach.

For more information, see https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-openapi.html#using-pregenerated-openapi-documents[Using pregenerated OpenAPI documents].


== Supported OpenAPI versions

The MicroProfile OpenAPI feature generates structured documentation based on the OpenAPI specification. Each new version of the OpenAPI specification updates the documentation format, and different versions of MicroProfile OpenAPI support different OpenAPI specification versions.

.Supported OpenAPI versions
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Feature | OpenAPI versions supported

|`mpOpenAPI-4.0`
| 3.1, 3.0

|`mpOpenAPI-3.1`
| 3.0

|`mpOpenAPI-3.0`
| 3.0

|`mpOpenAPI-2.0`
| 3.0

|`mpOpenAPI-1.1`
| 3.0

|`mpOpenAPI-1.0`
| 3.0
|===

If you are using a feature that supports more than one version of the OpenAPI specification, you can switch between versions with configuration. You might need to do this if you or your end users use tools or libraries that don't yet support a newer version of the OpenAPI specification.

For example, you can select OpenAPI v3.0 when using `mpOpenAPI-4.0`.

[source,xml]
----
<mpOpenAPI openAPIVersion="3.0"/>
----

[#multi-module]
== Multiple application and multi-module application support with MicroProfile OpenAPI

When multiple applications, or applications with more than one web module are deployed to the same Open Liberty server, the behavior differs between MicroProfile OpenAPI feature versions.


.Multiple application and multi-module application support with MicroProfile OpenAPI
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Feature |Behavior

|`mpOpenAPI-4.0`
|By default, all deployed applications and modules are included in the structured documentation. This can changed through configuration.

|`mpOpenAPI-2.0` to `mpOpenAPI-3.1`
|By default, only the first web module of the first application deployed is included in the structured documentation. This can be changed through configuration.

|`mpOpenAPI-1.0` to `mpOpenAPI-1.1`
|Only the first web module of the first application deployed is included in the structured documentation. This cannot be changed.
|===

[#serverxml]
== Configuring multiple application and multi-module support using server.xml

For MicroProfile OpenAPI 2.0 and later, you can control the applications and modules that are included in the structured documentation by using the `<includeApplication>`, `<excludeApplication>`, `<includeModule>`, and `<excludeModule>` elements within the `<mpOpenAPI>` xref:reference:config/mpOpenAPI.adoc[configuration element].

For example, to include all deployed applications and modules in the generated structured documentation when using `mpOpenAPI-2.0`, add the following configuration to your `server.xml` file.

[source,xml]
----
<mpOpenAPI>
  <includeApplication>all</includeApplication>
</mpOpenAPI>
----

For example, to include all deployed applications and modules except the `admin` module of `application1`, add the following configuration to your `server.xml` file.

[source,xml]
----
<mpOpenAPI>
  <includeApplication>all</includeApplication>
  <excludeModule>application1/admin</excludeModule>
</mpOpenAPI>
----

**Notes:**

- The application name is determined by the value of the `name` attribute when the application is deployed in `server.xml` using `<application>`, `<webApplication>`, or `<enterpriseApplication>`. For example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<webApplication name="application1" location="application1-v1.war" />
----
+
If the application is deployed in the `dropins` directory or if the `name` attribute is not specified, the name defaults to the archive filename with the extension removed.
+
- The module name is specified in the web module's `web.xml` file. If there is no `web.xml` file or if it does not specify a name, the module name defaults to the filename with the extension removed.

You can also override the `info` section of the OpenAPI document using the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<mpOpenAPI>
  <info title="Example API"
        version="1.0"
        description="This is an example API"/>
</mpOpenAPI>
----

This override may be useful when documenting multiple modules or applications. Without it, the `info` section would be replaced with a standard one indicating that documentation from several modules was merged.


=== Configuring multiple application and multi-module support using MicroProfile Config

You can configure the modules and applications to be included in the structured documentation by using MicroProfile Config, with the following limitations:

- If conflicting configuration is found in the `server.xml` file, the MicroProfile Config settings are ignored.

- The configuration properties must be set by using a configuration source that is not specific to an application. For example, you can use system properties, environment variables, or `<variable>` elements in the `server.xml` file.

The following table lists the MicroProfile Config properties that can be specified to configure which modules or applications are included in the generated OpenAPI documentation.

.Configuration properties for multiple application and multi-module application support
[%header,cols="3,6,6a"]
|===

|Property name
|Description
|Valid values

|`mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.include`
|This property specifies which modules or applications are included in the generated OpenAPI documentation.
|
* `all` +
This value includes all modules and applications in a deployment.
* `first` +
This value includes only the first web module of the first application deployed.
* A comma-separated list of `_application_name_` or `_application_name_/_module_name_` includes the named applications and modules.

|`mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.exclude`
|This property overrides the `mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.include` property to specify which applications or web modules are excluded from the generated OpenAPI documentation.
|
* `none` +
This value excludes no applications or web modules.
* A comma-separated list of `_application_name_` or `_application_name_/_module_name_` excludes the named applications and modules.

|`mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.info`
|This property sets the `info` section of the final Open API document. If it is set, the `info` section in the final OpenAPI document is replaced with the value of the property. This replacement is made after any merging is completed.
|The value must be https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#infoObject[a valid OpenAPI info section] in JSON format.

|===

**Notes:**

- When you configure support for multiple applications and multi-module environments by using MicroProfile Config, the application name is taken from the application's deployment descriptor (application.xml or web.xml). If there is no deployment descriptor or if it does not specify a name, the name defaults to the application archive filename with the extension removed.
+
- The module name follows the same rules as described for the server.xml configuration.
