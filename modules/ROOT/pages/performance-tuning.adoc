= Performance tuning for Open Liberty

Open Liberty supports different attributes in the `server.xml` file to influence application performance.
You can tune these parameters and attributes of Open Liberty to achieve better performance.

The following sections provide more information about tuning parameters and attributes of Open Liberty:

* <<#jvm, Tune the JVM>>
* <<#transport_channel, Tune transport channel services>>
* <<#tune_defaultexecutor, Tune the default executor>>
* <<#decrease_responsetime, Decrease response time of servlets>>
* <<#idle_cpu, Reduce idle server CPU time>>
* <<#startup_time, Tuning startup time>>


[#jvm]
== Tune the JVM
Tuning the JVM is the most important tuning step for configuring an environment.
When you tune the JVM for Open Liberty, use the `jvm.options` file in the `${server.config.dir}` directory.
You can specify each of the JVM arguments that you want to use, one option per line.

Specify the JVM arguments, one option per line, as shown in the following example:

[source,console]
----
-Xms50m
-Xmx256m
----

Setting the minimum heap size and maximum heap size to the same value can provide the best performance by avoiding heap expansion and contraction.

[#transport_channel]
== Tune transport channel services
The transport channel services manage client connections, I/O processing for HTTP, thread pools, and connection pools.
For applications on Open Liberty, the following attributes are available for different elements that can be used to improve runtime performance, scalability, or both.
In the following table, the examples show you how to code these options in the `server.xml` file:


.Logging configuration settings
[cols="d,d,l,d", options="header"]
|===
| Server configuration | Attribute | Example | Description

|config:httpOptions[]
|maxKeepAliveRequests
|<httpOptions maxKeepAliveRequests="-1" />
|This option specifies the maximum number of persistent requests that are allowed on a single HTTP connection if persistent connections are enabled.
A value of -1 means unlimited. This option supports low latency or high throughput applications, and SSL connections for use in situations where building up a new connection can be costly.

|config:connectionManager[]
|maxPoolSize
|<connectionManager ... maxPoolSize="40" />
|This option specifies the maximum number of physical connections for the connection pool.
The default value is 50. The optimal setting here depends on the application characteristics.
For an application in which every thread obtains a connection to the database, you might start with a 1:1 mapping to the coreThreads attribute.

|config:connectionManager[]
|purgePolicy
|<connectionManager ... purgePolicy="FailingConnectionOnly" />
|This option specifies which connections to end when a stale connection is detected in a pool.
The default value is the entire pool. It might be better to purge only the failing connection.

|config:connectionManager[]
|numConnectionsPerThreadLocal
|<connectionManager ... numConnectionsPerThreadLocal="1" />
|This option specifies the number of database connections to cache for each executor thread.
This setting can provide a major improvement on large multi-core machines by reserving the specified number of database connections for each thread.
Using thread local storage for connections can increase performance for applications on multi-threaded systems.
When you set `numConnectionsPerThreadLocal` to 1 or more, these connections per thread are stored in thread local storage.
When you use `numConnectionsPerThreadLocal`, consider two other values:
* The number of application threads
* The connection pool maximum connections
For best performance, if you have **n** applications threads, you must set the maximum pool connections to at least **n** times the value of the `numConnectionsPerThreadLocal` attribute and you must use the same credentials for all connection requests.

|config:dataSource[]
|statementCacheSize
|<dataSource ... statementCacheSize="60" >
|This option specifies the maximum number of cached prepared statements per connection. To set this option, complete the following prerequisite:
* Review the application code (or an SQL trace that you gather from the database or database driver) for all unique prepared statements.
* Ensure that the cache size is larger than the number of statements.

|config:dataSource[]
|isolationLevel
|<dataSource ... isolationLevel="TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED">
|The data source isolation level specifies the degree of data integrity and concurrency, which in turns controls the level of database locking.
Different options are available for the default transaction isolation level. For more information, see `isolationLevel` in config:dataSource[dataSource].

[#tune_defaultexecutor]
== Tune the default executor

The Open Liberty default executor is self-tuning and adapts to the current workload by dynamically adding or removing threads.
For most workloads, the executor does not require any tuning, and you are advised not to change any settings of the executor unless you encounter specific problems with thread creation.

For more information, see xref:ROOT:pages/thread-pool-tuning.adoc[Thread pool tuning].


[#decrease_responsetime]
== Decrease response time of servlets

To decrease response time of servlets, add the following attribute to the `server.xml` file:

[source,sh]
----
<webContainer skipMetaInfResourcesProcessing="true"/>
----


[#idle_cpu]
== Reduce idle server CPU time

To reduce idle server CPU time, add the following attributes to the `server.xml` file:


[source,sh]
----
<applicationMonitor dropinsEnabled="false" updateTrigger="disabled"/>
<config updateTrigger="disabled"/>
----

When the attributes are added, your server no longer monitors for configuration or application updates.

The `updateTrigger` attribute can also be set to the value of MBean for both the `applicationMonitor` element and the `config` element.
This setting allows applications and configurations to be updated by an `MBean` method.
However, some amount of CPU time is used.
To reduce the amount of CPU time used, you can set the `pollingRate` attribute of the `applicationMonitor` element and the `monitorInterval` attribute of the `config` element to large values.

The following example shows how to reduce the amount of CPU time that is used when you set the `updateTrigger` attribute to the value of MBean:

[source,sh]
----
<applicationMonitor updateTrigger="mbean" pollingRate="60s"/>
<config updateTrigger="mbean" monitorInterval="60s"/>
----


[#startup_time]
== Tuning startup time

By default, the feature:cdi[display=Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection] feature scans all application archives. This feature can increase startup time substantially and have the most effect on larger applications.
Implicit archive scanning for annotations can be disabled by setting the `enableImplicitBeanArchives` value to `false`. This setting skips the scanning of archives unless they contain a `beans.xml` file.

[source,sh]
----
<cdi12 enableImplicitBeanArchives="false"/>
----

The Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection feature might be included even if it is not in the features section of your `server.xml` file because other features include it, such as the feature:microProfile[display=MicroProfile] feature and the feature:webProfile[display=Jakarta EE Web Profile] feature.
